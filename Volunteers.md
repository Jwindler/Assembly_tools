**Announcement Calling for Volunteers: Open Source Genome Assembly Project**

Dear bioinformatics enthusiasts, we sincerely invite you to join our open source genome assembly project!
We aim to bring together volunteers from around the world who are interested in the development and application of genome assembly tools and work together to advance the field.

By working together, we will create an open, flexible and easy-to-use resource that will allow researchers to easily select and apply the tools that best suit their research purposes.



## Description

1. Our project will collect and organize currently available genome assembly tools, including but not limited to assembly software for different algorithms, auxiliary tools, and related documents and tutorials.
2. We will establish a unified code base and document base through the Github platform to facilitate users to review and contribute.



## Purpose

1. Provide a comprehensive genome assembly tool resource to help researchers conduct genome assembly and analysis more efficiently.
2. Promote open source collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of genome assembly, and accelerate the innovation and development of tools.



## Volunteers

We welcome volunteers with the following characteristics to join our project:
1. Have strong interest in bioinformatics and genome assembly, and have relevant knowledge background.
2. Familiar with commonly used programming languages (such as Python, R) and version control tools (such as Git).
3. Have good teamwork spirit and communication skills, and be able to actively participate in discussions and contribute your own ideas and suggestions.
4. Applicants with experience in contributing to open source projects will be given priority.



## Benefits

As a member of our program, you will gain the following benefits:

1. Participate in an open source project and contribute to the development of the genome assembly field.
2. Collaborate with peers from around the world to learn and share the latest technologies and ideas.
3. Improve personal technical skills and teamwork skills, and gain valuable practical experience in projects.
4. Establish a good social network, meet like-minded partners, and jointly pursue the progress of bioinformatics.



If you are interested in our project and would like to contribute to it, please send an email to jzjlab@163.com and briefly introduce your personal background and how you would like to participate.

We eagerly look forward to your joining, and let us work together to build a more prosperous genome assembly community!

Sincerely invite, 

Open source genome assembly project
